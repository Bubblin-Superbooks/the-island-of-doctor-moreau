<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>It was about seven or eight weeks after my landing,&mdash;rather more, I think, though I had not troubled to keep account of the time,&mdash;when this catastrophe occurred. It happened in the early morning&mdash;I should think about six. I had risen and breakfasted early, having been aroused by the noise of three Beast Men carrying wood into the enclosure.</p><p>After breakfast I went to the open gateway of the enclosure, and stood there smoking a cigarette and enjoying the freshness of the early morning. Moreau presently came round the corner of the enclosure and greeted me. He passed by me, and I heard him behind me unlock and enter his laboratory. So indurated was I at that time to the abomination of the place, that I heard without a touch of emotion the puma victim begin another day of torture. It met its persecutor with a shriek, almost exactly like that of an angry virago.</p></div> </div>
