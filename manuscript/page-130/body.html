<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I got up and sat down before the food. I had a heavy feeling in my head, and only the vaguest memory at first of the things that had happened over night. The morning breeze blew very pleasantly through the unglazed window, and that and the food contributed to the sense of animal comfort which I experienced. Presently the door behind me&mdash;the door inward towards the yard of the enclosure&mdash;opened. I turned and saw Montgomery's face.</p><p>“All right,” said he. “I'm frightfully busy.” And he shut the door.</p><p>Afterwards I discovered that he forgot to re-lock it. Then I recalled the expression of his face the previous night, and with that the memory of all I had experienced reconstructed itself before me. Even as that fear came back to me came a cry from within; but this time it was not the cry of a puma.</p></div> </div>
