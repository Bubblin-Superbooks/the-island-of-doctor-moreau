<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>He became silent. I sat in silence watching his face.</p><p>â€œSo for twenty years altogether&mdash;counting nine years in England&mdash;I have been going on; and there is still something in everything I do that defeats me, makes me dissatisfied, challenges me to further effort. Sometimes I rise above my level, sometimes I fall below it; but always I fall short of the things I dream. The human shape I can get now, almost with ease, so that it is lithe and graceful, or thick and strong; but often there is trouble with the hands and the claws,&mdash;painful things, that I dare not shape too freely. But it is in the subtle grafting and reshaping one must needs do to the brain that my trouble lies. The intelligence is often oddly low, with unaccountable blank ends, unexpected gaps.</p></div> </div>
