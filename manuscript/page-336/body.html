<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> There came a season of thunder-storms and heavy rain, which greatly retarded my work; but at last the raft was completed.</p><p>I was delighted with it. But with a certain lack of practical sense which has always been my bane, I had made it a mile or more from the sea; and before I had dragged it down to the beach the thing had fallen to pieces. Perhaps it is as well that I was saved from launching it; but at the time my misery at my failure was so acute that for some days I simply moped on the beach, and stared at the water and thought of death.</p><p>I did not, however, mean to die, and an incident occurred that warned me unmistakably of the folly of letting the days pass so,&mdash;for each fresh day was fraught with increasing danger from the Beast People.</p></div> </div>
