The substance of the chapter entitled “Doctor Moreau explains,” which contains the essential idea of the story, appeared as a middle article in the Saturday Review in January, 1895. This is the only portion of this story that has been previously published, and it has been entirely recast to adapt it to the narrative form.</p></div> </div>
