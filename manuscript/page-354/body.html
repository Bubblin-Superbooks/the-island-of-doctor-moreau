I have withdrawn myself from the confusion of cities and multitudes, and spend my days surrounded by wise books,&mdash;bright windows in this life of ours, lit by the shining souls of men. I see few strangers, and have but a small household. My days I devote to reading and to experiments in chemistry, and I spend many of the clear nights in the study of astronomy.
