Then suddenly it turned parallel with the edge of a steep-walled gap, which came without warning, like the ha-ha of an English park,&mdash;turned with an unexpected abruptness. I was still running with all my might, and I never saw this drop until I was flying headlong through the air.</p><p>I fell on my forearms and head, among thorns, and rose with a torn ear and bleeding face. I had fallen into a precipitous ravine, rocky and thorny, full of a hazy mist which drifted about me in wisps, and with a narrow streamlet from which this mist came meandering down the centre. I was astonished at this thin fog in the full blaze of daylight; but I had no time to stand wondering then.</p></div> </div>
