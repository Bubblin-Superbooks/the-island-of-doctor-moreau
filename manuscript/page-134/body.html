The memory of his work on the transfusion of blood recurred to me. These creatures I had seen were the victims of some hideous experiment. These sickening scoundrels had merely intended to keep me back, to fool me with their display of confidence, and presently to fall upon me with a fate more horrible than death,&mdash;with torture; and after torture the most hideous degradation it is possible to conceive,&mdash;to send me off a lost soul, a beast, to the rest of their Comus rout.</p></div> </div>
