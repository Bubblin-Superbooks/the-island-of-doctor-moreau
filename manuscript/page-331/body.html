I scarcely noticed the transition from the companion on my right hand to the lurching dog at my side.</p><p>As the carelessness and disorganisation increased from day to day, the lane of dwelling places, at no time very sweet, became so loathsome that I left it, and going across the island made myself a hovel of boughs amid the black ruins of Moreau's enclosure.
