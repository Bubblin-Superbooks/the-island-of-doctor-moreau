<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>“What ship is this?” I said slowly, hoarse from my long silence.</p><p>“It's a little trader from Arica and Callao. I never asked where she came from in the beginning,&mdash;out of the land of born fools, I guess. I'm a passenger myself, from Arica. The silly ass who owns her,&mdash;he's captain too, named Davies,&mdash;he's lost his certificate, or something. You know the kind of man,&mdash;calls the thing the Ipecacuanha, of all silly, infernal names; though when there's much of a sea without any wind, she certainly acts according.”</p><p>(Then the noise overhead began again, a snarling growl and the voice of a human being together. Then another voice, telling some “Heaven-forsaken idiot” to desist.)</p></div> </div>
